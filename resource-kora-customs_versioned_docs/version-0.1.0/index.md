# kora_customs

Public, self-service cosmetic vehicle customisation for the qbcore2 stack.
It is intentionally separate from `kora_mechanic`: no work orders, employee
job, servicing, or performance upgrades are included. The only repair is the
optional paid self-service fallback for when no mechanic is on duty
(`Config.selfRepair`, below).

## Features

- Live previews with complete rollback on cancel, failed payment, or resource stop.
- Three configurable public shops with target interactions and map markers.
- Standard body modifications, liveries, wheels, paint, custom RGB paint,
  interior colours, tint, plates, horns, xenon, neon, tyre smoke, and extras.
- Server-authoritative ownership, driver-seat, entity, plate, model, location,
  routing-bucket, field allow-list, and price validation.
- Cosmetic persistence through `kora_core:saveVehicleProperties`; the resource
  never writes `player_vehicles` directly.
- `provide 'qb-customs'` for dependency compatibility. A real `qb-customs`
  resource must not run alongside this one.

Configure locations and prices in `config.lua`. Players target a shop while
sitting in the driver seat of an owned vehicle. Side-scroll menu values to
preview them, then choose **Purchase changes**. The bank account is used by
default. Set `Config.ui.compactActions = true` for short Prev/Next/Pick button labels.

**Part camera.** With `Config.camera.focusParts = true` (default), choosing an
option glides a scripted camera to the part being changed (wheels, bumpers,
exhaust, spoiler, hood, roof, interior, plate, lights; paint/body show a 3/4
overview). `Config.camera.fields` maps vehicle fields and `Config.camera.views`
maps shop tabs to entries in `Config.camera.presets` (bone, fallback point,
direction, distance, fov), so servers can tune any framing. The camera uses
vehicle bones with a model-size fallback, is restored on close, and is stopped
while **Freecam** is active. Set `focusParts = false` for the normal camera.
Presets with an `eye = { bone, fallback, offset }` table put the camera inside
the cabin (the Interior tab does); window tint uses the `sideWindow` preset.

**Keeping the part clear of the panel.** The shop panel covers the right of the
screen, so the camera is turned to put the framed part in the free area beside
it (`Config.camera.avoidPanel`, `panelMargin`, `screenShift`; the panel width
comes from `Config.ui.width` / `layout`). Presets can opt out with
`avoidPanel = false` and add an aim `offset`. The Interior view sits between and
behind the front seats and looks at the middle of the dashboard; while it is
active (`Config.camera.cabin`) the player is hidden for the local client, a
white fill light lights the cabin, and a leftover screen blur / timecycle is
cleared. The **Hide menu** button (`Config.ui.previewButton`) closes the panel
so the whole screen shows the vehicle; Enter, Backspace or Escape brings it back.

**Escape and the pause menu.** In **Freecam** Escape cancels exactly like
Backspace (back to the previous view, then the panel reopens). With
`Config.ui.blockPauseMenu = true` (default) GTA's pause menu (Escape / P) is
disabled while Freecam or Hide menu is up, and after Escape ends a view or
closes the panel it stays disabled until the key is released plus
`Config.ui.pauseGuardMs` (default 250 ms), so the map never opens behind the shop.

**Movable panel.** `Config.ui.draggable` and `Config.ui.rememberPosition` are
sent to the kora_lib app shell as `draggable` / `rememberPosition` (with
`positionKey`). A shell that supports them lets the player drag the panel by its
header, clamped to the screen, remember the position per player and reset it with
a double-click on the header; older shells ignore the fields. The shell must be a
kora_lib build that includes the draggable app shell (`draggable`,
`rememberPosition`, `positionKey` in `Kora.nui.registerApp`). `Config.ui.defaultSide`
(`'right'` default, `'left'`) picks the side the panel opens on and the camera frames
the part on the opposite side; `'left'` needs a shell that accepts
`placement = 'left'`, otherwise the shop keeps the right-hand panel.

**Previews are never saved.** Previews exist only on the vehicle entity; the
server persists only what checkout validates and charges. Every way out that is
not a completed purchase (Escape, X, Discard changes, a failed or refused
checkout, leaving the seat or the shop, dying, the vehicle disappearing,
resource stop) puts the original properties back, including paint, pearlescent,
custom RGB and window tint, and checks that paint and tint really came back.
Factory window glass (tint -1) is put back as clear glass (tint 0, None),
because the game can take a -1 and still show the previewed tint.
`Config.previewGuard` backs this up: `recheckMs` (500) after a revert the car is
read again and any previewed field that still differs is put back (up to
`attempts`, 3); with `reapplyOnOpen` (default) the client remembers the fields
previewed in a session that ended unpaid, and if the car still shows one of
those previews when the shop next opens on it, the earlier value goes back on
before the car is read (so it cannot become the factory look below). A field
showing anything else, or one bought since, is left alone.
The window tint row lists every tint in the game's order: Factory (-1), None,
Pure Black, Dark Smoke, Light Smoke, Stock, Limo, Green (0 to 6).
Paint has a price per category in `Config.prices`: `primaryPaint`,
`secondaryPaint`, `customPrimary`, `customSecondary` (custom RGB),
`pearlescent`, `wheelPaint` and `windowTint`. A key left out falls back to
`paint` (or `customPaint` for custom RGB), the two keys older configs had. The
shop rows show these prices and the checkout charges them.
Checkout prices every changed field on the server and refuses a field whose
price is missing or 0 unless `Config.interaction.allowFreeFields = true`.
The client price is only compared with the server's; the charge happens before
anything is saved, and an order that cannot be paid is never persisted. If
Escape closes the panel while a paid order is still being processed, the paid
look is applied back to the vehicle.

Parking the vehicle is the other place a look can be saved: kora_garages stores
the properties the client reads off the vehicle. Keep its
`Config.TrustClientCosmetics = false` so paint, tint and every other cosmetic
field comes from the stored (paid) row instead of an unpaid preview.

**Factory look.** kora_dealership saves a bought car with no stored look, and
kora_garages (`Config.SaveUnstoredLook = false`) then stores none when it is
parked, so the game could give it other colours each time it is spawned. With
`Config.factoryLook.enabled` (default), opening the shop on your own car whose
row has no look yet stores the look the client read off the car when the
session opened, before any preview, as the car's baseline; paid orders then
merge on top of it. The server checks the shop, the driver, ownership, plate and
model, keeps only the shop's cosmetic fields (each checked like an order field;
never performance mods, plate, fuel or condition), charges nothing, and does
it once per plate while the resource runs. `fillMissing` (default on) also adds
the fields a row with only part of a look lacks (a car customised before it
was first parked); fields already stored always win. Previews only exist on the
client, so the server trusts the client for this one snapshot: a modified
client could store a look it never paid for on such a car, once. Turn
`enabled` off if that matters more than keeping factory colours.

**Horn preview.** `Config.hornPreview`: the selected horn sounds once when it
changes (Previous / Next / Choose), and the horn row has a **Test horn** button
that plays the fitted horn once per click. Each play runs the horn's whole
preview length, and a new click cuts the running one and starts again from the
beginning, so previews never loop or overlap. `holdToTest = true` turns the
button into **Hold to test horn** instead: the horn sounds continuously while
the button is held (mouse, Enter or Space) and stops on release, capped at
`maxHoldMs`. With it, a click shorter than the horn's preview length still
plays the whole horn once (`clickPlaysFull = true`, default; `false` stops it
on release). Hold to test needs a kora_lib app shell with `hold` actions; older
shells show a plain button that plays the horn once.
GTA only taps a horn while a player sits in the driver seat (`StartVehicleHorn`
ignores its duration then), and the shop keeps the player there. With
`method = 'input'` (default) the preview starts the horn on the player's own
vehicle and holds its key (control 86) for the preview length, as a player
holding the horn would, so nearby players hear it too. `method = 'proxy'`
sounds a hidden, local copy of the vehicle with nobody in it instead; testers
heard nothing from it, so it is no longer the default. The length comes from `byIndex[horn index]`, then
the first `durations` rule whose `match` text is in the horn's name (musical
horns 8 s, loop horns 10 s), then `durationMs` (3 s, plain horns).
The rules match the English names; translate them for other game languages.
`holdKey` (off by default, needs `holdToTest`) maps a key that holds the horn
the same way; the game only sees that key while the panel is hidden. Set autoPlay/button to `false` to
turn them off.

**Self-service repair.** `Config.selfRepair` (enabled by default) adds a
**Repair vehicle** target option at every shop for the driver. With
`onlyWhenNoMechanics` it only shows, and the server only accepts it, while no
player with one of `mechanicJobs` is on duty (kora_core's on-duty counts). The
player confirms the `price`, waits through a `durationMs` progress bar, and the
server then re-checks the shop, driver seat, distance, routing bucket, mechanics
and the per-character `cooldownSeconds` before charging `account`; the engine,
body and fuel tank are then fixed. Set `enabled = false` to keep the shop purely
cosmetic.

**Targeting from the driver seat.** kora_target blocks targeting while seated
(`Config.target.disableInVehicle`). The shop options set `allowInVehicle = true`
so **Customise vehicle** and **Repair vehicle** still work from the driver seat
(hold the target key, ALT by default). `Config.targetAllowInVehicle` (default
`true`) controls this; `false` leaves the field off. Older kora_target builds
ignore the field.

**Who can use the shop.** There is no job check: the shop is a public,
self-service cosmetic shop. Access is decided by the location (a `Config.shops`
entry, the player must be at it), sitting in the driver seat, and the vehicle
being owned by that player; checkout re-verifies all of this on the server.

Performance fields (`modEngine`, `modBrakes`, `modTransmission`,
`modSuspension`, `modArmor`, and `modTurbo`) and vehicle condition/fuel are not
accepted by the server.

## API

Client:

```lua
exports.kora_customs:open('bennys')
```

The id must exist in `Config.shops`; checkout still enforces its server-side
distance and routing-bucket policy.

## Test

```sh
./test/run.sh
```
